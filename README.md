Set
=========

The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(game)" target="_blank">Set</a> card game created with backbone.js

See it live <a href="http://nathancharles.github.io/set/" target="_blank">here</a>

### Getting a Set

> Several games can be played with these cards, all involving the concept of a set. A set consists of three cards which satisfy all of these conditions:

> - They all have the same number, or they have three different numbers.
> - They all have the same symbol, or they have three different symbols.
> - They all have the same shading, or they have three different shadings.
> - They all have the same color, or they have three different colors.

> The rules of Set are summarized by: If you can sort a group of three cards into "Two of \_\_\_\_ and one of \_\_\_\_\_," then it is not a set.

### TODOs
- add specific reason why selected cards are not a set when validation fails
- add better ending screen, recap and option to reset the game
- add ability to get a hint (select a card in a set)
